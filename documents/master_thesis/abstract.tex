A load-flow calculation is a key element in planning and running power nets. During the past centuries only iterative methods with insufficient convergence behaviour were available for this task. Recent research resulted in a new approach for this problem, the so-called \emph{Holomorphic Embedding Load Flow} (\emph{HELM}). During this thesis I will explain how this method can be applied and compare it to the iterative methods. I will show that the superior convergence behaviour of \emph{HELM} enables the load-flow calculation of nets closer to their border of stability than with iterative methods. This is reached by a trade-off with respect to runtime; therefore, in practice one has to evaluate the use of \emph{HELM}.
