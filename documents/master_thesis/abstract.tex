A load-flow calculation is a key element in planning and running power nets. During the past centuries only iterative methods with insufficient convergence behaviour were available for this task. Recent research resulted in a new approach for this problem, the so-called \emph{Holomorphic Embedding Load Flow} (\emph{HELM}). This thesis explains how this method can be applied and compares it to the iterative methods. Furthermore, experimental results show that the superior convergence behaviour of \emph{HELM} enables the load-flow calculation of nets closer to their border of stability than with iterative methods. This can be reached by a trade-off with respect to runtime through special settings. With default settings \emph{HELM} delivers already more accurate results in comparable runtime to the iterative methods. Therefore, in practice one has to evaluate the use of \emph{HELM} with high accuracy settings, but it can be used out-of-the-box for most cases.
